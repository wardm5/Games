# Tap Out (Finger Game)
Tap Out is a fun game that you may play with your friends. This version is with either other humans or AI.

The game is designed with OOP in mind with a 'main' method that starts the game by calling a Game class.
When the game class is called, other classes such as Options (to change the difficulty of the AI or remove in game text) can be updated.
Players are also instantiated through different methods within game and players are kept in an array of players.
